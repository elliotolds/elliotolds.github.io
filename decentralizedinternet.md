title: Can The Internet Decentralize Society?
permalink: /decentralizedinternet
---

What will be the long run effect of the Internet on the distribution of power? Will the nature of the Internet lead to centralization? Will governments and big tech companies closely cooperate to strengthen their control over society? Or can the [cypherpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) dream of the Internet as a tool of individual freedom and privacy be realized?

These questions are discussed in [The Centralized Internet Is Inevitable](https://palladiummag.com/2020/10/19/the-centralized-internet-is-inevitable/) by [Samo Burja](https://twitter.com/SamoBurja). The essay argues (as its title suggests) that the Internet is an inherently centralizating technology. [Palladium](https://palladiummag.com/) editor and cofounder [Wolf Tivy](https://twitter.com/wolftivy) has also expressed support for this theory:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The future is total surveillance for total compliance of every action, word, and thought. This is the world we are bringing into being with technology.<br><br>The unavoidable telos of technological means is totalitarian power.</p>&mdash; Wolf Tivy (@wolftivy) <a href="https://twitter.com/wolftivy/status/1197295213565239296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There are several factors that cause me to doubt this.

# **Our information landscape has already been massively decentralized by the Internet**

Compare our modern information landscape to that of 1990. Traditional institutions now have far less ability to control information flow and narratives. People are able share information, build large audiences, and coordinate without the permission of traditional gatekeepers. 

This is a direct result of the Internet, and the effects on society have been enormous. Perhaps the most significant of these effects is the erosion of perceived legitimacy of legacy institutions and elites, as argued by [Martin Gurri](https://twitter.com/mgurri) in [The Revolt of the Public: And the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium](https://www.amazon.com/Revolt-Public-Crisis-Authority-Millennium/dp/1732265143) ([podcast with transcript](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/martin-gurri-revolt-of-the-public/), [ten minute version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhSaPi_zAyY&ab_channel=MartinGurri)).

Individuals now have access to far more points of view and information than in the pre-Internet era, and are able to more easily challenge authorites instead of taking their word for what's happening and what it means. To borrow some of Gurri's [talking points](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/martin-gurri-revolt-of-the-public/): in the days of John F. Kennedy the US public's trust in government would range between 70-80%. Today it's under 30%. For congress it's under 20%. Can you imagine a network TV anchorman being voted the most truthworthy man in America today? 

The two most powerful organizations in the United States, the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee, along with the vast majority of the traditional media were all strongly opposed to Donald Trump becoming president in 2016 and yet it didn't matter. This couldn't have happened pre-Internet.

People like [Joe Rogan](https://www.youtube.com/user/PowerfulJRE) and [Pewdiepie](https://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie) have developed influence that dwarfs that of media brands. There are countless people like [Eric Weinstein](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq9jO8fmlPee9ezOraOHAJ3g9Zh3V2F2G) operating on a smaller scale who are able to push anti-establishment narratives to large audiences. 

Many Silicon Valley venture capitalists have stopped talking to the New York Times and other traditional media sources because the Internet allows them to get their message out on their own terms. The grassroots social justice movement went mainstream largely due to the Internet. [QAnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon) and flat earth conspiracy theorists are thriving in the new decentralized information landscape.

# **Doesn't all this "decentralization" exist at the mercy of big tech companies?**

One might object that most of these popular individual brands are created on tech platforms like YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter. Anti-estalishment narratives mainly use these platforms to spread. So isn't this all just a manifestation of a tendency toward centralization? 

First, we should compare the effect of the Internet to what existed without it, not to some idealized world of perfect decentralization. Is the information landscape far more decentralized now than it was in 1990? Even if Twitter sometimes censors a link from the New York Post or adds a disclaimer to the President's tweet, the answer is obvious. 

Second, if you already have a large audience you can survive a coordinated deplatforming across all major tech companies. [Alex Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones) was effectively canceled by the big Western tech companies, which did reduce his influence, yet InfoWars still reaches more people than The Economist or Newsweek. Someone like Rogan is effectively uncancelable. By relying on decentralized technologies like his email list, website, and podcast (podcasting architecture is not controlled by the major tech companies) he would remain hugely influential.

Third, although there are only a small handful of tech companies that dominate the market for user attention in the West, as of now they still have incentives to compete with one another for attention and to keep their users happy. Users are usually against deplatforming people, which is one reason it only happens to people like Alex Jones or [Richard Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_B._Spencer). Systems like Bitcoin have shown us that a situation where many large actors could exercise their power in harmful ways can still be stable and aligned with user interests when those actors have the right economic incentives.

# **What about China?**

The big tech companies in China cooperate more closely with the [CCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party) than American tech companies do with the US government. They've maintained a tigher control on the flow of information and on narratives than Western governments have been able to. If a similar situation of tight cooperation between tech and government were to develop in Western countries it would be pretty concerning. Fortunately it may not be possible for this sort of sitation to develop in the West.

The key to this argument is that different initial conditions can lead to very different equilibria. When the Internet started becoming widely used, the CCP started from a place of higher information control than Western governments. They made a deliberate choice to maintain high information control over the course of the Internet's rise, and they've largely been successful. This took a lot of effort and planning. Western countries adopted a more laissez faire attitude and as a result have suffered the crisis of institutional authority described above.

Imagine two surfers as a wave approaches. One starts in a good position on top of his board, and is able to catch and ride the wave. The other surfer starts in the water and doesn't see the wave. It crashes down on him, followed by wave after wave continuing to crash down on him as he struggles just to catch his breath. Maybe if the second surfer could somehow get on top of his board he'd be able to ride safely to shore, but that may not be possible given his starting position and where he is in the ocean now.

Similarly, maybe the US government could have avoided the crisis of authority and pressured tech companies into helping it solidify its power if it had more foresight before the Internet developed. But the US government is now in a situation where it lacks legitimacy. Without legitimacy it's likely much harder to enact the far reaching policies (mandated encryption backdoors for instance) that would be needed to transition to high information control over its citizens while being constantly battered by the legitimacy-eroding power of the Internet.

# **The details of technological change matter and are hard to predict**

It didn't have to be the case that that end to end encryption could be done in a user friendly enough way to be feasible in the [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)) app. But the innovations people made just caused things to work out that way. As a result, people are able to communicate privately over the Internet without a lot of hassle. 

<!---
(We'll return to the issue of whether governments can read your Signal messages later).

Right now technologists are working on another problem: creating a private, secure, uncensorable form of digital money that's easy to use and can support billions of users. They've made a lot of progress since Bitcoin launched in 2009 but there are still unsolved problems. It's unclear to what degree they'll succeed, but the answer to this question will have a huge impact on the structure of power in the future.

<!---
Technologists are also working on yet another problem: a decentralized social media network that can't be censored or shut down by governments or companies. Like with cryptocurrency there are many unsolved problems but if it be made to work in a user-friendly way the implications for the structure of power are huge.

It's hard to put an exact date on when the Internet first existed, but a case could be made that it was around the mid 80s. It took about 20 years sicne then for its decentralizing effects on information to be felt. Bitcoin has existed for 11 years, Ethereum for five. What does it mean that Bitcoin and Ethereum haven't significantly decentralized the world's monetary system yet? <!---Or that we haven't figured out how to create a decentralized social network yet?--> There's no reason why these things should take the same amount of time (or half the time) that it took the internet to decentralize the information ecosystem.

If we step back from foreseeable innovations and zoom out, we appear to be in an era of extremely rapid growth, which some models suggest will only accelerate.

The argument that the Internet may lead to decentralization of power doesn't rest on aggresive economic growth forecasts, but to the extent that you think that such models are plausible it should add uncertainty to long term predictions.

Not long ago there was no good way to communicate securely over your phone, and now billions of people have access to user friendly end to end encryption.

# **Can't governments just backdoor our software and hardware?**

The Burja essay makes several claims in this area that I believe are overstated. 

First is that governments "[will not](https://tech.newstatesman.com/security/the-eu-is-set-to-declare-war-on-encryption) [stand for encryption](https://web.archive.org/web/20200425113543/https://blog.privacytools.io/us-government-wages-war-on-encryption/) software without backdoors". The links show that parts of the US and EU governments are attempting to introduce laws mandating encryption backdoors. However government officials have been trying to do this for a long time. As in previous iterations, privacy advocates are fighting baack. It's not clear that the governments will win this battle, especially since they are operating in this new world of reduced legitimacy. 

Currently it's plausible that WhatsApp's 1.6 billion monthly users really do have access to working end to end encryption, and it's even more plausible (since Signal is open source) that Signal's users are using working end to end encryption. 

Another claim is that the hardware backdoors have been mandated in the US, with [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20200425113543/https://blog.privacytools.io/us-government-wages-war-on-encryption/) given as supporting evidence. As far as I can tell the article is about a former NSA director planning to get access to data from US tech companies about its users (possibly through encryption backdoors), but is doesn't seem to be about hardware backdoors.

[This](https://www.pcmag.com/news/does-your-motherboard-have-a-secret-chinese-spy-chip) is presented as evidence that China has mandated hardware backdoors in chips used by US companies. It references a controversial [Bloomberg story](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies) alleging that the Chinese motherboard company Supermicro created its chips with backdoors, which were sold to parts of the US government. The [Wikipedia article on Supermicro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermicro) discusses this issue. It seems unclear whether this is true.

There is concern from the US government about using [other Chinese hardware](https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-military-purchased-32-8m-worth-of-electronics-with-known-security-risks/) as well. It does seem plausible that some Chinese hardware is compromised, although it appears that the NSA has [backdoored Cisco routers](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cisco-backdoor-hardcoded-accounts-software,37480.html). However what isn't clear is to what extent governments can easily gain access to a random US citizen's computer or phone.
