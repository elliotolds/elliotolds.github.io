title: Can The Internet Decentralize Power?
permalink: /decentralizedinternet

What will be the long run effect of the Internet on the distribution of power? Will governments and big tech companies closely cooperate to strengthen their control over society?  Or can the [cypherpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) dream of the Internet as a tool of individual freedom and privacy be realized?

<!---
removed from above: Does the nature of the Internet lead to centralization?

These questions are discussed in [The Centralized Internet Is Inevitable](https://palladiummag.com/2020/10/19/the-centralized-internet-is-inevitable/) by [Samo Burja](https://twitter.com/SamoBurja) and in [this podcast](https://palladiummag.com/2020/10/30/palladium-podcast-46-samo-burja-on-why-regulating-online-speech-is-unavoidable/) featuring Burja and [Palladium](https://palladiummag.com/) editor and cofounder [Wolf Tivy](https://twitter.com/wolftivy). Their position is that the Internet is an inherently centralizating technology.

I'll describe below how the Internet has already decentralized power to a large degree and why we might expect a continuation of this trend.

# **The Internet has decentralized information**

<!---
was: Our information landscape has already been massively decentralized by the Internet 
-->

Compare the information landscapes in Western countries now vs. in 1990. Today we have easy access to a much wider variety of information and narratives, and these narratives tend to be more critical of large institutions and elites than the narratives people were exposed to in the past. 

<!--
People are able share information and build large audiences with minimal interference from intermediaries. This is a direct result of the Internet.

 The effects on society have been enormous. Perhaps the most significant effect
 -->
 
 These critical narratives have eroded of the perceived legitimacy of our institutions and elites, as described by [Martin Gurri](https://twitter.com/mgurri) in [The Revolt of the Public](https://www.amazon.com/Revolt-Public-Crisis-Authority-Millennium/dp/1732265143) ([podcast with transcript](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/martin-gurri-revolt-of-the-public/), [ten minute version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhSaPi_zAyY&ab_channel=MartinGurri)).

<!---
To borrow some of Gurri's [talking points](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/martin-gurri-revolt-of-the-public/): in the days of John F. Kennedy the US public's trust in government would range between 70-80%. Today it's under 30%. Trust in congress is under 20%. Can you imagine a network TV anchorman being voted the most truthworthy man in America today?
-->

<!---
---- IMPROVE THIS
People can now dive as deeply as they want to into 
The amount of detailed anti-establishment narratives that people have access to today is astounding. Some of them started grassroots and have become mainstream (the social justice movement, Trumpism, Brexit and general anti-immigration sentiment), many are not quite mainstream but have huge followings (the alt-right, the dirtbag left, covid skepticism, climate change skepticism, antifa, ANnon, etc.)
-->

<!---
Imagine you were disillusioned with your society's institutions in 1990. Where would you go for critical perspectives? How would you know which perspectives to investigate? 

Maybe you'd go to the library and browse books on socialism or anarcho-capitalism, or try to find some anti-establishment magazines. Maybe you'd call up your edgiest friend and ask their advice. 

Suppose you somehow found a critical narrative that appealed to you. To make it meaningful to your life it would help to find a community of likeminded people. How would you find them? If you wanted to convince more people of the truth of this narrative, how would you do so using the technology of 1990?
-->

<!---
If it were in a book it might take a lot of work to figure out how it applies to current society. It'd be nice to have people to help with that,


The Internet has made the number of potential content channels essentially infinite, and this has had a profound impact on how filtering of content happens.
-->

In the pre-Internet era, everyone was deplatformed by default. 

There were a limited number of TV channels, radio stations, and newspapers making it necessary for information distributors to exercise heavy curation. This gave information distributors cover to curate partly based on the content's narrative. They wanted to distribute profitable content, but they also wanted to trade favors with powerful people and institutions who didn't want to be criticized.

Limited informaiton channels also made it more profitable to try to appeal to a broad swath of the population. The high costs of pre-Internet information distribution gave advertisers more control over content. Both of these factors limited anti-estalbishment narratives.

<!---
In addition to there being far fewer communication channels, owning a communication channel pre-Internet was expensive. Information distributors were dependent on advertisers who were often not comfortable with anti-estalbishment narratives. 
-->

Today (almost) everyone can have a platform, but it's still true that only a small percentage of people can have a large platform. There's still a fixed amount of attention to go around. Content on the Internet is implicitly filtered, but this filtering is done mostly based on popularity, without the strict narrative filter that exists in legacy media.

<!---
Maybe the best example of this is Joe Rogan, whose podcasts have wider reach than the top network TV news shows. A recent guest on Rogan's podcast, Alex Jones, is one of the rare people to have been deplatformed by almost all of the big Internet tech companies. Yet because of the fairly decentralized nature of the Internet, Jones's website InfoWars still gets almost ten times as many readers as The Economist despite elites being almost unilaterally against him. 
-->

<!---Jones is still able to appear on the most popular podcast in the world. Rogan's podcast is now hosted by Spotify, but because podcasting infrastructure is not controlled by the major tech firms he could always return to independent distribution

 recently had an episode with Alex Jones. Jones is one of the rare people who have been deplatformed by most of the big Internet tech companies
 -->

So much information is produced on the Internet that people no longer need to ever return to the fold of mainstream narratives. Before the Internet even if you were reading some subversive books and magazines you still probably got much of your news from TV or newspapers. Today someone might get almost all of their understanding of what's going on in the world and what it means from The Joe Rogan Experience, Eric Weinstein, Chapo Trap House, Scott Alexander, and reddit.

Governments, the media, corporations, and educational institutions can no longer control which narratives are taken seriously in society, and this is a direct result of the Internet.

<!---
[critical narratives did exist in the pre-internet era, they just had a hard time spreading and were much less sophisticated. you might have met someone once who told you that they world was run by an elite pedophile ring, but only on the internet can you easily find the most convincing people in the world who subscribe to this theory, and only on the internet can bleievers in this theory easily share information to build their theory into a more complex, self-consistent system.]
-->

<!---
When huge numbers of narratives compete without much narrative filter it results both in huge anti-elite platforms like The Joe Rogan Experience, and a long tail of influencial but less popular anti-elite narratives from Eric Weinstein, Scott Alexander, Mencius Moldbug, Chapo Trap House, etc. Whereas before you'd have to go looking hard for this type of anti-elite view, now they're all just a click away from every Internet user.
-->


<!---
Second, whereas in the pre-Internet era there was a sharp dropoff in accessibility for all but the most popular content, on the Internet everything is available but the less popular things are just a little harder to find. Combined with the relative lack of a narrative filter on Internet content this means that you can find pretty much whatever view you like.

Third, not only are there lots of channels, but the amount of content per channel is often huge. Being a regular consumer of content from Eric Weinstein, Scott Alexander, or Mencius Moldbug lets you basically import extremely nuanced worldviews into your mind. One might object "but you could always have done this by reading books". To a degree, but aside from the fact that most people vastly prefer consuming Internet info to reading books, the sharability of Internet content makes these narratives more powerful.
-->
<!---
---draw a picture of the smoothness of the curve now vs. before when at the top people had lots of reach, then there was a big gap, then lots of people with smaller reach...
-->
<!---
The other big difference is that on the Internet being unpopular doesn't fully deplatform you, it just makes you harder to find. There exists a long tail


And the content that isn't the most popular isn't actually gone, you just have to try a little harder to seek it out. We've gone from a hard filter based on both popularity and narrative conformity to a soft filter based almost entirely on popularity.


By default everyone has a (small) platform, and it's only in exceptional cases that someone's platform is taken away.

The Internet has also reduced the cost of creating and distributing content. Lower costs mean that you're less reliant on ads to pay for your content distribution, and less restricted by corporate reluctance to be associated with controversial narratives.

The Internet also encourages advertizers to have to explicitly associate with the content their ads appear near. When buying a TV or magazine ad, advertizers know exactly which TV show or magazine their ad will appear in. This allows people to hold them accountable for implicitly endorsing unpopular content. An advertiser on YouTube had plausible deniability because they likely have no idea which channels their ads are being shown on.

In the Internet era you can reach huge audiences with no advertising. If you do have ads and your content is controversial



Imagine creating a website vs. a print magazine, a podcast vs. a radio show, a YouTube channel vs. a TV show. When you don't have large creation and distribution costs, you can reach large audiences without large corporate advertizers. If you do have ads, the Internet allows a degree of separation between content producers and advertizers so controversial content can be monetized without the advertizer having to make an explicit decision to endorse whatever content their ad appeared near.

Even more important than the lowering of costs is the increase in the numbers of channels available. There number of TV and radio networks

Before the Internet there were a lot of barriers to spreading information, particularly anti-estalbishment narratives. 

The startup cost of creating a niche magazine was high, and the ongoing distribution costs meant that you needed advertisers to explicitly associate themselves with your narrative. When you see an ad while watching a YouTube conspiracy video, the advertizer has plausible deniability that they had no idea which videos YouTube would put their ad on.

--creation and distribution costs

-low bandwidth.. low number of information channels..  (newspapers, economics)

--The large startup cost of creating a niche magazine means that many people with similar ideas would never find each other.

What if many other people felt similarly to you, but none of them had taken on the large cost of starting a magazine or a group that you were able to find?

advertizers... 

In the pre-Internet world it was pretty tough to find or spread narratives that ran counter to what was broadcast at you via TV, newspapers, and the radio. College campuses were perhaps the closest thing we had to the Internet -- environments where large numbers of people interested ideas could share information and come up with critical narratives without direct mediation from gatekeepers. (which caused them to play a large role in the civil rights and anti-war movements in the US.)

NOTE: restrict bandwidth: 99.99% of people are deplatformed... it's a convenient excuse to deplatform someone for their views.
    you can give them SOME airtime, but then the counter-narrative can have all of the rest of the airtime, as the default

Imagine yourself as a disaffected citizen in 1990. You sense the two party political system and mainstream media are kinda shady and you don't feel like you can support them. Where do you go to find likeminded people? How do get get access to alternative points of view? Before the Internet this was far more difficult. If you found some non-mainstream ideas in a book or obscure magazine, it was hard to find a community around them or to spread your perspective to others. It's much easier to share a link on Twitter than to get your friends to subscribe to a socialist magazine.

Now you can go onto the Internet and immerse yourself as deeply as you want into the narratives of the social justice movement, the Chapo Traphouse crew, antifa, neoreaction, conrtapoints, joe rogan, sam harris, eric weinstein, bret weinstein, the alt-right, covid-skeptics, slatestarcodex, palladium, daniel schmactenberger, joe rogan, qanon. 

There is so much content being produced that you can get more information than you can keep up with just from a handful of sources. Before even if you were reading communist books, you were still getting your daily news from TV networks or newspapers. Now you can get all your information from Rogan, the Weinstein brothers, and Palladium magazine and completely cut out any mainstream sources.

<!---
The most influential of these narratives on the left is the social justice movement, which has been fueled largely via the Internet. Although progressive elites strategically harness social justice narratives to win favor, social justice is a grass roots movement that seeks to replace the current power structure. Other left wing groups that have anti-elite narratives that are much more influential than they could ever be before the Internet include the Bernie Sanders movement (including the dirtbag left as featured on Chapo Trap House), antifa, sam harris, eric weinstein, bret weinstein].

On the right there is Trumpism (he's now president, but the two most powerful organizations in the US opposed him: the GOP and DNC), Brexit, the alt-right, anti-corona, anti-climate change, anti-immigration, neoreaction, Qanon]

There are also anti-establishment narratives
-->


<!---

People like [Joe Rogan](https://www.youtube.com/user/PowerfulJRE) and [Pewdiepie](https://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie) have developed influence that dwarfs that of all big the biggest media brands. There are countless people like [Eric Weinstein](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq9jO8fmlPee9ezOraOHAJ3g9Zh3V2F2G) and [Mencius Moldbug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin) operating on a smaller scale who are able to push anti-establishment narratives into the public consciousness. 

Many Silicon Valley venture capitalists have stopped talking to the New York Times and other traditional media sources because the Internet allows them to get their message out on their own terms. The grassroots social justice movement went mainstream largely due to the Internet. [QAnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon), flat earthism, and other anti-elite conspiracy theories are all thriving in the new information landscape.

# **Doesn't all this "decentralization" exist at the mercy of big tech companies?**

One might object that most anti-elite narratives are spread via big tech platforms like YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter. These companies are becoming more and more powerful, isn't this just a manifestation of a tendency toward centralization? 

The reason why this hasn't lead to more centralization of information control is that in the world of near-infinite information channels, deplatforming someone is much more conspicuous than in the pre-Internet era. As described above, traditional media platforms must always exercise judgment about who they broadcast because of limited space, and they can use these judgments to deplatform people for reasons that are not obvious.

In the world of big tech platforms, deplatforming is the exception and the act of doing it attracts attention and demands an explanation.

Tech platforms do impose some narrative filter on information. There have been coordinated deplatformings of [Alex Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones) and [Richard Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_B._Spencer). Twitter recently prevented sharing of a story by the New York Post, and Twitter sometimes puts content warnings on tweets, including Donald Trump's. Tech platforms have started instututing "soft" filters on some content by reducing the likelyhood that it appears in users' feeds.

It's important to compare this narrative filtering with what existed before the Internet. We're trying to figure out whether the Internet is leading us toward more centralization than what existed before, not whether it leads to more centralization than an imaginary ideal situation. 

Jones and Spencer would never have had their narratives broadcast on mainstream media pre-Internet. Even after his deplatforming, Jones (via his site InfoWars) has almost ten times greater reach than The Economist. Jones' most recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience has over 15 million YouTube views (YouTube's ban on Jones does not extend to other channels that host him), 60% more views than ABC Nightly News, the top rated network TV news show.

<!---
Before he moved his postcast to Spotify, Joe Rogan's self-hosted postcast got about 11 million listens per episode, which is about how many people watch the top rated non-sports network TV show (NCIS). Podcast infrastructure is not under the control of big tech platforms, so

After being criticized by by conservative politicans and by users for blocking the Washington Post story about Hunter Biden, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said that they did the wrong thing and would change their policy.

In the West, tech platforms have provided much more neutral platforms than what existed before the Internet. Later in the essay we'll look at whether they might one day use their growing power to swing the pendulum back in the other direction.


<!---

Later in the essay we'll return to the game theory between tech companies, governments, and citizens, and whether 
-->

<!---

Tech platforms usually engage in censorship for one of two reasons:

(1) The employees and management of these companies tend to lean left, and sometimes they get overzealous and use their power unfairly. This is generally bad for the company as it creates a lot of controversy, alienates conservative users, and makes the company a target of conservative politicians.

(2) To try to appease politicians on the left. Whereas politicians on the right are watching tech platforms for any sign of unfair censorship, politicians on the left are watching for signs of allowing the spread of 'misinformation'. Just as conservative politicians will berate them if they censor too much, liberal politicians will berate them if they don't censor enough. Although people in these companies are politically biased, at the very top the CEOs mostly want to avoid regulation and avoid having either side upset at them. It's a delicate balancing act.
-->

<!---
Big tech companies like Twitter and Facebook do not want to get involved in censorship, but they currently face political pressure from both sizes and are not sure how best to avoid becoming a target. 
-->

<!---
These companies would prefer to be neutral platforms who didn't have to worry about coming under fire from political factions.
If a big tech platform clearly and unambiguously allied with the democratic party, it would be unwise because the amount of damage that could be done if the other party every got into power is enormous. in a 4 year term they could completely destroy the company. They're all trying to be Switzerland.
-->
<!---
Someone like Rogan is effectively uncancelable. By relying on decentralized technologies like his email list, website, and podcast (podcasting architecture is not controlled by the major tech companies) he would remain hugely influential even if deplatformed by all major tech platforms.
-->

# **What about China?**

The big tech companies in China cooperate more closely with the [Chinese Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party) than American tech companies do with the US government. The CCP have maintained tigher control on the flow of information and on narratives than Western governments have been able to. If a similar situation of close cooperation between tech and government were to develop in Western countries it could lead to significant centralization of power. 

It may unlikely for this sort of sitation to develop in the West. 

When the Internet started becoming widely used, the CCP started from a place of higher information control than Western governments. They made a deliberate choice to maintain high information control over the course of the Internet's rise, and they've largely been successful. This took a lot of effort and planning. 

Western countries adopted a more laissez faire attitude and as a result have suffered the crisis of institutional authority described above.

Maybe the US government could have avoided the crisis of authority and pressured tech companies into helping it solidify its power if it had more foresight before the Internet developed. But the US government is now in a situation where it lacks legitimacy. Without legitimacy it's much harder to enact and enforce the far reaching policies (mandated encryption backdoors for instance) that would be needed to transition to high information control over its citizens while being constantly battered by the legitimacy-eroding power of the Internet.

# **Technological tools for resisting centralized power are proliferating**

Digital privacy advocates have been trying to get people to use end to end encryption for decades. Until recently they had no significant success because there was no user-friendly option. 

Now 2 billion WhatApp users have end to end encryption enabled by default, and Zoom just released [their own end to end encryption feature](https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-rolling-out-end-to-end-encryption-offering/). Signal offers the same end to end encryption as WhatApp but reveals less metadata and is open source. Signal is as usable as any other messaging app and has become widely used among Black Lives Matter protesters, the European Commission, and the UK's ruling Conservative party. It's becoming common knowledge among savvy people that if you care about privacy you should use Signal.

Some Western governments, including the US, have made efforts to [ban end to end encryption](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/western-governments-double-down-efforts-to-curtail-end-to-end-encryption). Tech companies and security experts are against such bans. Given that the Intenet has already stripped Western governments of much of their perceived authority, it's far from clear that citizens will hand their governments the power to read all of their messages.

Burja claims that the US government has already mandated harware backdoors, but there are in fact no such laws (the link given in support of this is about the government gaining access to data stored by cloud service providers). 

The state of the art for law enforcement trying to access an iPhone's data that they have posession of is trying every passcode combination, which you can protect yourself against with a long passcode (10 digits will take about 12 years). There are [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute) instances of the FBI and NSA being unable to get into an iPhone that is properly secured. 

<!---
Governments may be able to hack into your phone using [sophisticated spyware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)) if they can get you to click on a link, but proably not if you have the latest iPhone OS. 

In general if have an iPhone with the latest OS and have a long passphrase the government won't be able to access your phone's content regardless of whether they physically have the phone. Some devices may be backdoored, especially Chinese divices, but if so this is done in secret. It's likely that the majority of phones, laptops, and desktop devices built in Western countries are not backdoored.
-->



<!---
(We'll return to the issue of whether governments can read your Signal messages later).
-->

Right now technologists are working on another problem: creating a private, secure, uncensorable form of digital money that's easy to use and can support billions of users. They've made a lot of progress since Bitcoin launched in 2009 but there are still unsolved problems. It's unclear to what degree they'll succeed, but the answer to this question will have a huge impact on the structure of power in the future.

<!---
Technologists are also working on yet another problem: a decentralized social media network that can't be censored or shut down by governments or companies. Like with cryptocurrency there are many unsolved problems but if it be made to work in a user-friendly way the implications for the structure of power are huge.
-->

It's hard to put an exact date on when the Internet first existed, but a case could be made that it was around the mid 80s. It took about 20 years sicne then for its decentralizing effects on information to be felt. Bitcoin has existed for 11 years, Ethereum for five. What does it mean that Bitcoin and Ethereum haven't significantly decentralized the world's monetary system yet? <!---Or that we haven't figured out how to create a decentralized social network yet?--> There's no reason why these things should take the same amount of time (or half the time) that it took the internet to decentralize the information ecosystem.

If we step back from foreseeable innovations and zoom out, we appear to be in an era of extremely rapid growth, which some models suggest will only accelerate. The following image represents [simulations of economic growth trajectories](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/modeling-human-trajectory) by [David Roodman](https://davidroodman.com/about/).

<div><br></div>

<div><br></div>
The argument that the Internet may lead to decentralization of power doesn't rest on aggresive economic growth forecasts, but to the extent that you think that such models are plausible it should add uncertainty to long term predictions.

<!---
Not long ago there was no good way to communicate securely over your phone, and now billions of people have access to user friendly end to end encryption.

# **Can't governments just backdoor our software and hardware?**

The Burja essay makes several claims in this area that I believe are overstated. 

First is that governments "[will not](https://tech.newstatesman.com/security/the-eu-is-set-to-declare-war-on-encryption) [stand for encryption](https://web.archive.org/web/20200425113543/https://blog.privacytools.io/us-government-wages-war-on-encryption/) software without backdoors". The links show that parts of the US and EU governments are attempting to introduce laws mandating encryption backdoors. However government officials have been trying to do this for a long time. As in previous iterations, privacy advocates are fighting baack. It's not clear that the governments will win this battle, especially since they are operating in this new world of reduced legitimacy. 

Currently it's plausible that WhatsApp's 1.6 billion monthly users really do have access to working end to end encryption, and it's even more plausible (since Signal is open source) that Signal's users are using working end to end encryption. 

Another claim is that the hardware backdoors have been mandated in the US, with [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20200425113543/https://blog.privacytools.io/us-government-wages-war-on-encryption/) given as supporting evidence. As far as I can tell the article is about a former NSA director planning to get access to data from US tech companies about its users (possibly through encryption backdoors), but is doesn't seem to be about hardware backdoors.

[This](https://www.pcmag.com/news/does-your-motherboard-have-a-secret-chinese-spy-chip) is presented as evidence that China has mandated hardware backdoors in chips used by US companies. It references a controversial [Bloomberg story](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies) alleging that the Chinese motherboard company Supermicro created its chips with backdoors, which were sold to parts of the US government. The [Wikipedia article on Supermicro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermicro) discusses this issue. It seems unclear whether this is true.

There is concern from the US government about using [other Chinese hardware](https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-military-purchased-32-8m-worth-of-electronics-with-known-security-risks/) as well. It does seem plausible that some Chinese hardware is compromised, although it appears that the NSA has [backdoored Cisco routers](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cisco-backdoor-hardcoded-accounts-software,37480.html). However what isn't clear is to what extent governments can easily gain access to a random US citizen's computer or phone.
