![me](mefb300.jpg)

I'm a software developer and independent researcher living in Lisbon.

My main interests include using technology to increase individual freedom, AI safety / existential risk, math, economics, philosophy, life extension, and the theory of disagreement.

I'm currently working on [Impact List](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LCJa4AAi7YBcyro2H/proposal-impact-list-like-the-forbes-list-except-for-impact), a project aimed at ranking the top ~1000 people in the world by impact via donations. I previously founded [Atstake](https://atstake.net), a platform for fairly enforcing two-person contracts using Ethereum. I've also done some preliminary work on [using prediction markets to improve institutional decision making](institutionaldecisionmaking). See my Projects page for more details.
