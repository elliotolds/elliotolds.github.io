![me](mefb300.jpg)

I'm a software developer and independent researcher living in Lisbon.

My main interests include using technology to increase individual freedom, AI safety / existential risk, math, economics, philosophy, life extension, and the theory of disagreement.

I'm currently working on starting an organization that aims to create and popularize a ranked list of the ~1000 living people who have had the most positive impact on the world via donations (think: Forbes List but for impact instead of wealth). See my post on [the effective altruist forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LCJa4AAi7YBcyro2H/proposal-impact-list-like-the-forbes-list-except-for-impact) about this. 

I'm a cofounder of [Atstake](https://atstake.net), a platform for fairly enforcing two-person contracts using Ethereum. (Inactive since 2020.)

I've previously done some preliminary work on [using prediction markets to improve institutional decision making](institutionaldecisionmaking). This project is no longer active but I may continue it in the future.
