My main interests include using technology to increase individual freedom, AI safety / existential risk, math, economics, philosophy, life extension, and the theory of disagreement.

The current focus of my work is aimed at reducing existential risks from artificial superintelligence. Recently I've been working on [Impact List](https://impactlist.xyz), a project aimed at ranking the top ~1000 people in the world by impact via donations. Prior to that I founded [Atstake](https://atstake.net), a platform for fairly enforcing two-person contracts using Ethereum. I've also done some preliminary work on [using prediction markets to improve institutional decision making](institutionaldecisionmaking). See my [Projects](projects) page for more details.
