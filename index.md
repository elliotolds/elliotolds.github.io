![me](mefb300.jpg)

I'm a software developer and independent researcher living in Seattle.

My main interests are using technology to increase individual freedom, AI safety / existential risk, math, economics, philosophy, and the theory of disagreement.

I'm a founder of [Atstake](https://atstake.net), a platform for fairly enforcing two-person contracts using Ethereum.

I'm also working on [using prediction markets to improve institutional decision making](institutionaldecisionmaking.md).

A while back I created a [wiki](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org) about popular debates in the Bitcoin world. It's currently a bit out of date.
