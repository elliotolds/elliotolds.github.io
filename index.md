# Elliot Olds

I'm a software developer and independent researcher living in Seattle.

My main interests are using technology to increase individual freedom, AI safety / existential risk, math, economics, philosophy, and the study of disagreement.

I'm a founder of [Atstake](https://atstake.net), a platform for fairly enforcing two-person contracts using Ethereum.

See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliotolds/) for detail on my background, but don't contact me there.


A while back I created a [wiki](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org) about popular debates in the Bitcoin world. It's currently a bit out of date.
