My main interests include increasing the chance that the creation of artificual superintelligence goes well, math, economics, philosophy, life extension, the theory of disagreement, and using technology to increase individual freedom.

Currently I'm splitting my time between investing (mostly in AI) and working on [Impact List](https://impactlist.xyz), a project aimed at ranking the top ~1000 people in the world by impact via donations. Prior to that I founded [Atstake](https://atstake.net), a platform for fairly enforcing two-person contracts using Ethereum. I've also done some preliminary work on [using prediction markets to improve institutional decision making](institutionaldecisionmaking). See my [Projects](projects) page for more details.
