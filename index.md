![me](ecrop4.jpg)

I'm an independent researcher currently working on reducing existential risks from artificial superintelligence. I previously worked on [Impact List](https://impactlist.xyz), a project aimed at ranking the top ~1000 people in the world by impact via donations. Prior to that I founded [Atstake](https://atstake.net), a platform for fairly enforcing two-person contracts using Ethereum. I've also done some preliminary work on [using prediction markets to improve institutional decision making](institutionaldecisionmaking). See my [Projects](projects) page for more details.

My main interests include using technology to increase individual freedom, AI safety / existential risk, math, economics, philosophy, life extension, and the theory of disagreement.
