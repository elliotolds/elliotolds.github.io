title: Will Technology Decentralize Power?

<i>This is a rough draft. Please do not share without permission.</i>

What will be the long run effect of technological progress on the distribution of power? Will governments and big tech companies closely cooperate to strengthen their control over society?  Or can the [cypherpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) dream of technology as a tool of individual freedom and privacy be realized?

These questions are discussed in [The Centralized Internet Is Inevitable](https://palladiummag.com/2020/10/19/the-centralized-internet-is-inevitable/) by [Samo Burja](https://twitter.com/SamoBurja) and in [this podcast](https://palladiummag.com/2020/10/30/palladium-podcast-46-samo-burja-on-why-regulating-online-speech-is-unavoidable/) featuring Burja and [Palladium](https://palladiummag.com/) editor and cofounder [Wolf Tivy](https://twitter.com/wolftivy). Their position is that the Internet is an inherently centralizing technology.

I'll describe below how technology has already decentralized power to a large degree and why we might expect a continuation of this trend.

# **The Internet has decentralized control of information**

Compare the information landscape in Western countries now to what it was in 1990. Today we have easier access to a wider variety of information and narratives, which are often more critical of large institutions and elites than the narratives people were exposed to in the past. This criticism has eroded the legitimacy of institutions and elites, as described by [Martin Gurri](https://twitter.com/mgurri) in [The Revolt of the Public](https://www.amazon.com/Revolt-Public-Crisis-Authority-Millennium/dp/1732265143) ([ten minute video version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhSaPi_zAyY&ab_channel=MartinGurri)).

<!---
Our increased exposure to these narratives is driven by our increased freedom to broadcast narratives with less interference from gatekeepers.

> It’s a lot easier now for random members of public -- you or me or anyone else -- to challenge what scientists are saying, what journalists are saying, what politicians are saying. To just throw rocks at them and say, “You guys are full of shit”. 

> -- Rob Wiblin in [his excellent podcast with Gurri](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/martin-gurri-revolt-of-the-public/)

In the pre-Internet era everyone was deplatformed by default. There were a limited number of TV channels, radio stations, and newspapers making it necessary for information distributors to exercise heavy curation. This gave information distributors cover to curate content partly based on its narrative. They wanted to distribute profitable content but they also wanted to trade favors with powerful people and institutions who didn't like criticism.

The small number of information channels meant there was no room for niche content -- it was most profitable to try to appeal to a broad swath of the population. The high costs of pre-Internet information distribution gave advertisers more leverage over content. Both of these factors limited anti-establishment narratives.

On the Internet almost everyone can have a platform, but it is still true that only a small percentage of people have a large platform. There's still a fixed amount of attention to go around. Content on the Internet is implicitly filtered (everyone only sees a minuscule fraction of all content produced) but this filtering is done mostly based on popularity. There is some narrative-based filtering but far less than exists in legacy media.

So much information is produced on the Internet that people no longer need to ever return to the fold of mainstream narratives. Before the Internet, even if you were reading subversive books you still probably got much of your news from TV or newspapers. Today someone might get almost all of their understanding of what's going on in the world and what it means from [Joe Rogan](https://www.youtube.com/user/PowerfulJRE), [Eric Weinstein](https://www.youtube.com/user/nobani88), [Chapo Trap House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapo_Trap_House), [Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/), and Reddit.

Governments, the media, corporations, and educational institutions can no longer control which narratives are taken seriously and this is a direct result of the Internet.


# **Doesn't this "decentralization" exist at the mercy of big tech?**

One might object that most anti-establishment narratives spread via YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, which are all becoming increasingly powerful platforms. Isn't this just a manifestation of a tendency toward centralization? 

Control of information is decentralizing despite this because in a world of near-infinite information channels deplatforming someone is more conspicuous than in a world of few information channels. Traditional media platforms must always exercise judgment about who they broadcast because of limited space, and they can use these judgments to deplatform people for reasons that are not obvious.

On Internet platforms deplatforming is the exception and the act of doing it attracts attention and demands an explanation.

Tech platforms do impose some narrative filters on information. There have been coordinated deplatformings of [Alex Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones) and [Gavin McInnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_McInnes). Twitter recently prevented sharing of [a story](https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/) by the New York Post (a decision Twitter later [said they were wrong to do](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1317081843443912706)), and Twitter sometimes puts warnings on tweets (including Donald Trump's). Tech platforms have started instituting "soft" filters on some content by reducing the likelihood that it appears in users' feeds. Recently YouTube [said it would start deleting videos](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165355/youtube-biden-election-victory-misinformation-rules-remove-content-oan) which claim that the 2020 US election results are fraudulent.

The censorship decisions of these companies are best understood as delicate balancing acts to avoid political heat -- censor too much and the right becomes upset, censor too little and the left becomes upset (that tech companies are helping to spread alleged misinformation or hate).

It's important to compare this narrative filtering with what existed before the Internet. The relevant question is whether the Internet is leading us toward more centralization than what existed before, not whether it's leading us to more centralization than we think is ideal. 

Jones and McInnes would never have had their narratives broadcast on mainstream media pre-Internet. Even after his deplatforming, Jones (via his site [InfoWars](https://www.infowars.com/)) has almost ten times greater reach than The Economist. Jones' [most recent appearance on Rogan's podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVso9FSkmE&t=4s&ab_channel=PowerfulJRE) has over 15 million YouTube views, 60% more views than the top rated network TV news show (ABC Nightly News).



# **What about China?**

Network effects have led to most Internet communication being mediated by a small number of companies. China has shown us that if these companies are captured by a government the effect on power can be strongly centralizing. However there may be no plausible path for this sort of capture to develop in the West. 

When the Internet was new the [Chinese Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party) was in a position of higher information control than Western governments. The CCP made a deliberate choice to maintain high information control over the course of the Internet's rise and they've largely been successful. This took a lot of effort and planning. 

Western countries made little effort to control the flood of information stemming from the Internet and as a result have suffered the crisis of institutional authority described above.

Maybe Western governments could have avoided this fate if they had acted sooner, but they're now in a situation of reduced legitimacy and little control over the narratives their citizens are exposed to. Without these things it's hard to enact and enforce the far reaching policies (restrictions on criticism of the government for instance) needed to transition to high information control over their citizens.

Rather than serve as an example of success to emulate, China's rise may harden Western citizens' resolve against authoritarian governance. When groups are in competition they often focus on and take pride in their differences. The narrative "In the West we are free, unlike in China" is appealing to Westerners and may become more so as conflict with China increases -- recall the heightened pro-freedom sentiment in the US during the Cold War.

# **Power dynamics in the US**

<!---
When an authoritarian government is able to fully control the tech platforms that its citizens use to communicate it creates a power structure that is difficult for citizens to push back against. The government can use the tech platforms' control of information to legitimize its authoritarian actions, as well as to quickly find and quell dissent. 
-->

Even though the US government [knows a lot about its citizens](https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet), its low information control and low legitimacy constrain the authoritarian actions it can take. For the US government to become significantly more powerful it would need to establish higher information control, which it could only achieve with the tech industry's help. 

However it is not in the interest of tech companies to help the US government become authoritarian. Such a system would lock tech companies into a subservient role, subject to the whims of the ruling party. Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Page have grand ambitions for their companies and do not want to be in the position of Jack Ma, who was likely [forced out of Alibaba](https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibabas-jack-ma-denies-beijing-forced-him-out-1537280485) by the CCP. 

In the US the balance of power between tech companies, government, and citizens is more evenly distributed than in China, leading to more of a (temporary) stalemate. In the struggle between tech platforms and the US government the support of the public is critical, making both groups cautious about abusing their power.


<!---
The existance of more than one strong political party in the US and its branches of government being somewhat independent provide additional defenses against government takeover of tech companies.

The US has multiple branches of government that are somewhat independent and more than a single strong political party, which adds exercise of government power. 

Many other Western countries have power distributed in similar ways to the US, giving them a similar level of  seizing control of technology platforms: some level of checks and balances within government, more than a single strong political party, and fair enough elections that politicians are constrained by public sentiment.

-->

<!---

The tech industry can use public opinion as a shield against government takeover, and the government can use public opinion as a hammer...

They'd prefer a world more like the one described in [The Soverign Individual](https://www.nateliason.com/notes/sovereign-individual), where governments are relatively weak and are forced to compete with each other to attract companies and citizens.

# **The Internet is destabilizing liberalism**

Palladium's [opening essay](https://palladiummag.com/2018/09/29/towards-the-post-liberal-synthesis/) defines liberalism as

> a political ideology that emphasizes a synthesis of individual rights, free markets, free speech, freedom of culture and religion, primacy of the individual over society, democracy, limited government, division of powers, checks and balances, and separation of church and state.

"Liberal" and "liberalism" will be used only in this sense below.

Broad acceptance of liberal principles in the West has served as a barrier against authoritarianism. These principles have not escaped the erosion of perceived legitimacy described by Gurri. Roberto Foa and Yascha Mounk [have found](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-danger-of-deconsolidation-the-democratic-disconnect/) that "The citizens of wealthy, established democracies are less satisfied with their governments than they have been at any time since opinion polling began."

Despite these changing attitudes, liberal Western democracies have mostly held firm. Freedom House's [comprehensive analysis of the rise of authoritarianism since 2006](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2017/breaking-down-democracy) finds that "The decade of decline has been principally characterized by a steady erosion of political institutions in established authoritarian countries, or in countries that were clearly headed in that direction."

<!---
Liberal norms and instutitions have not escaped the erosion of authority described by Gurri. Because liberal principles are explicitly non-authoritarian and liberalism was until recently so firmly established in the West, we should expect the destabilization of liberalism to make Western authoritarianism more likely.
-->

Hungary, Poland, and Turkey are often held up as concerning examples of democracies becoming more authoritarian, but these countries are culturally and historically different from the US and Western Europe in ways that make it unclear how far we can extrapolate their trends. Turkey [does not have a history of embracing liberal values](https://freespeechdebate.com/discuss/the-rise-and-fall-of-free-speech-under-turkeys-islamists/) and is overwhelmingmy Muslim. Poland and Hungary have long histories of communist rule which only ended in 1989.

In liberal countries the Internet has created a new barrier to authoritarianism (increased distrust of government power) while simultaneously weakening an old barrier (endorsement of liberal values). It's unclear what the overall effect of these opposing forces is on the likelihood that established liberal countries become authoritarian. 

Even if the likelihood of authoritarianism in these countries increases, the size of this increase is critical for understanding how things will unfold. Because this likelihood was so low during the pre-Internet peak of Western liberalism, it would take a huge shift to make authoritarianism inevitable.

<!---
Even if the likelihood of authoritarianism in these countries has increased, the size of this increase is critical. Because the likelihood was so low during the pre-Internet peak of Western liberalism, it would take a huge shift to result in anything resembling inevitibility.

There's a lot of room for Western countries to become somewhat more authoritarian than they were during the peak of the pre-Internet liberal order and still remain largely liberal. 


The likelihood of authoritarianism in liberal Western countries before the Internet was so low that a small increase wouldn't imply that authoritarianism will become a common form of governance in the West or that any specific country is on an inevitable path to authoritarianism. 


The Internet's erosion of governme has created a new barrier to authoritarianism by eroding government authority, while at the same time weakening

Even if the Internet's weakening of liberalism has made Western countries more likely to become authoriatarian, but this doesn't imply authoritarianism will become a common form of governance in the West or that any specific country is on an inevitable path to authoritarianism. There's a lot of room for Western countries to become a little more authoritarian than they were during the peak of the pre-Internet liberal order but still remain largely liberal.
-->

<!---
It may be that a few Western countries become somewhat more authoritarian but most settle into some new non-authoratarian equilibria.
-->



<!---
The West started from such a non-authoritarian position that there's a long way to go before we're all living under Chinese-style governance. 

When the starting point is almost completely non-authoritarian, 

There is a big difference between every country being on an inveitable path toward authoritarianism and a handful of Western countries being put on that path by a strong destablilizing force.

Yet there are many ways that something that makes authoritarianism more likely overall

What is unclear is what form this increased likelyhood taskes

.

 still fairly liberal forms of government whose citizens are more skeptical of liberal values, or whether as Burja and Tivy suggest we're on a path toward the type of authoritarinism seen in China.

we should expect most changes in political systems to be in the direction of more authoritarianism.

It is generally not countries which had formerly fully embraced liberalism that are becoming authoritarian. 

Liberal norms and instutitions have not escaped the erosion of authority described by Gurri. Given that the West was very liberal in the recent past, any destabelizaton of

The erosion of institutional authority brought about by the Internet makes these institutions more vulnerable to bieng displaced. The previous world order of Liberalism 

When a country's existing political establishment has its authority eroded by the Internet, it is more likely to be displaced. 

___'s extensive report on the rise of authoritarianism beginning in 2006 characterizes this rise as resulting mostly from existing authoritarian countries becoming more so.


-->

# **Immigration and liberalism**

<!---
Openness to immigration is a value which is frequently associated with liberalism. 
-->

In Western countries liberal institutions and elites are far more in favor of large scale immigration than the public. This disconnect was a major factor behind the election of Donald Trump in the US and of Brexit in the U.K. The increases in authoritarianism in Poland and Hungary were aided by the unpopular immigration policies of the more liberal politicians who were displaced.

In general authoritarian-leaning politicians are getting a relative boost in popularity because of the unwillingness of liberal politicians to move more in line with the public on immigration. Yet liberal values are not inherently incompatible with stricter immgration policy. In the pre-Internet era elites could impose their immigration preferences on the public via their higher control of information channels, but they can no longer do so. Once liberal politicians fully internalize this lesson authoritarians may lose one of their best tools for gaining support.

<!---
Before the Internet, institutions and elites in liberal countries could use their control over information channels to marginalize anti-immigration sentiment. Post-Internet they can no longer do this. In general, the enthusiasm for immigration by liberal institutions serves to hand a weapon to their less liberal opponents that can be used to displace them from power.


For example, imagine a hypothetical model where when liberal societies are destabilized by the Internet 10% of them become fully authoritarian and the remaining 90% settle into other equilibria that may be less liberal than before in some ways but are not authoritarian nor on a path to becoming so. In such a scenario there would be an overall rise in Western authoritarianism due to technology, but technology would not make authoritarianism inevitable.



...Theres one other set of beliefs not described in Palladium's description of liberalism that was pushed by elites and instutitions in liberal societies and is unpopular with citizens: support of large scale immigration.

# **Tools for resisting centralized power are becoming widespread**

Digital privacy advocates had tried and failed to get people to use end-to-end encryption for decades. Technical challenges prevented the existence of user-friendly options and people didn't care enough to go through the cumbersome process of using these tools. 

This changed in 2010 with the release of [TextSecure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextSecure), which evolved into [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)). Signal uses [end-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption), produces [very little metadata](https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/), is open source, and is as easy to use as any other messaging app. Signal has become popular among [protesters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/style/signal-messaging-app-encryption-protests.html), [the European Commission](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150918/european-commission-signal-encrypted-messaging), and the [UK's ruling Conservative party](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150918/european-commission-signal-encrypted-messaging).

[WhatsApp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp), the world's most popular messaging app, has integrated Signal's technology and now two billion WhatApp users have end-to-end encryption enabled by default. [Zoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)), the world's most used video conferencing software, just released [their own end-to-end encryption feature](https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-rolling-out-end-to-end-encryption-offering/) in October 2020. 

We are in the midst of a massive global rollout of end-to-end encryption. For the first time in history normal people are regularly communicating remotely in a way that governments and companies lack the power to listen in on.

Thousands of software developers and researchers are now working on another problem: creating a private, uncensorable form of digital money that's easy to use and can support billions of users. If they succeed in separating money from the state it will make it much more difficult for authoritarian governments to control their citizens.

Cryptocurrency isn't yet widespread 12 years after its creation and there are many unsolved problems, but progress is steadily being made and 12 years isn't that long. It was 25 years between the release of [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) (difficult to use encryption software) and when end-to-end encryption became widely used. It was at least 20 years between the invention of the Internet and when its decentralizing effects on the flow of information became significant.



# **Can't governments backdoor our software and hardware?**

Western governments have tried since the 1990s to [ban end-to-end encryption](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/western-governments-double-down-efforts-to-curtail-end-to-end-encryption) and have mostly failed, with the partial exception of Australia's recent [anti-encryption law](https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/). This law has been [controversial](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2020/08/assistance-and-access-law-encrypted-messaging-explained/) and has been blamed for [reducing the competitiveness of Australia's tech industry](https://www.zdnet.com/article/labor-to-introduce-bill-to-fix-australian-encryption-laws-it-voted-for/).

I call this law a partial exception because Australians can still use end-to-end encryption via Signal and WhatsApp. It is not technically possible for the Signal team to comply with the law, so the Australian government's options involve blocking Internet traffic to and from Signal servers or pressuring Apple and Google to remove Signal from their Australian app stores. They've done neither of these so far, and [Signal's blog post](https://signal.org/blog/setback-in-the-outback/) about this legislation reveals how to easily bypass both of these measures.

The situation in Australia is worth watching but we won't get a good sense for whether Western countries could actually ban end-to-end encryption unless the Australian government makes a more serious effort to criminalize its use. 

The US government has worked with tech companies to [secretly get access to citizens' cloud data](https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet) and they have probably [secretly backdoored some hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cisco-backdoor-hardcoded-accounts-software,37480.html) but there are no US laws mandating that computer hardware contain government backdoors. 

<!---
The bloomberg story often cited as evidence of Chinese hardware being backdoored is widely disputed by security experts. The general consensus is that bloomberg should have retracted the story. There are suspicions that Lenevo hardware may have been backdoored but this has never been established.
-->

The most effective technique for governments trying to access data on an iPhone in their possession is [trying every passcode combination](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/technology/iphone-encryption-police.html). Users can protect themselves against this with long passcodes (10 digits will take about 12 years). There are [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute) instances of the FBI and NSA failing to get into iPhones. 

Governments may be able to hack into your phone remotely using [sophisticated spyware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)) if they can get you to click on a link, but probably not if you have the latest iPhone OS.

Given that the Internet has already stripped Western governments of much of their perceived authority, it's far from clear that citizens will hand these governments the additional power they need to access all of our data. We are not yet living in an authoritarian state -- Western politicians still fear the consequences of enacting and enforcing unpopular laws.

# **The Internet is making physical location less important**

When humans were hunter-gatherers power was much more decentralized than it is today. One group could not rule over that many people both because the state of technology meant that the ability to inflict violence was proportional to the size of a group, and because the lack of permanent settlements made it easy for subgroups to leave.

The invention of agriculture allowed permanent settlements, caused the accumulation of large stores of wealth that were hard to move, and created economic network effects around physical locations. Whoever controlled a location could extract resources from those wanting to benefit from being near it. Our modern system of nations is a continuation of this trend.

The Internet is bringing us back to a situation where it's less important to physically be in any one place. We can now get close to the center of economic and intellectual activity from any physical location. This increases competitive pressure on governments and tilts power toward individuals.

# **Technology and power**

Most technologies increase power across the full spectrum between large organizations and individuals, but they do so unevenly in ways that depend on the details of each technology.

Artificial intelligence becomes more effective the more data and computing power you have, so we should expect it to increase the power of large organizations more than smaller ones. The [crossbow](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/from-crossbows-to-cryptography.pdf) is an example of a technology which helped individuals more than large organizations -- it enabled untrained peasants to effectively wield deadly force. Encryption and cryptocurrency also help to level the playing field between large organizations and individuals. We've seen how the Internet produces effects that shift power unevenly in both directions.

Because the distribution of power depends so much on the technological landscape, predicting the distribution of power depends to a large degree on predicting the future of technology. Such predictions have always been difficult but are especially so today given that we're in [a period of rapid technological progress](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/modeling-human-trajectory).

# **Centralization is not inevitable**

Whether power centralizes or decentralizes in the future depends on the specific details of current and future technology, the existing structure of power when this technology is developed, and many other difficult to analyze forces.

Weighing these forces against one another and predicting the future shape of power is an enormously complex task. Burja's essay focused on several forces pushing us in the direction of centralization of power, but as we've seen there are many other strong forces pushing in the opposite direction. 

For those who prefer to avoid an authoritarian future it would be a mistake to prematurely accept that fate.

<!---



There are enough significant factors pushing us away from centralization of power that it seems from inevitable. F

This issue is very complex and there are many factors that neither Burja nor I have mentioned in our essays. It's possible to present a compelling case in either direction

This is an eormously complex issue and there are many other factors that have not been mentioned. It's possible to present a compelling case in either direction through

We've seen strong enough factors pushing in the direction of decentralization that centralization of power seems far from inevitable. 

<!---

but we've seen many factors pushing in the direction of decentralization. 

The details of a technology matter a lot to the question of whether it will centralize or decentralize power. The Internet has created effects in both directions. Centralized social media networks can be a very useful tool for authoritarian governments, but their effect on power is less clear when they can remain uncaptured.


...but the landscape of possible technologies is vast

Whether power will become more or less centralized is an enormously complex question. 

-->

<!---

# **New conclusion**

We now have a simple model that fits the data better than "technological progress is a centralizing force":

If a government can capture the tech platforms its citizens use, then it can use those platforms as a tool to centralize power. If a government can't capture tech platforms, then the critical narratives on thoes platforms will erose its authority and destabelize it. Destabelization can in some cases lead to authoritarianism, but this depends on many factors urelated to the power of the tech platforms.

<!---
# **Inevitability**

In Magic the Gathering there's a concept called "[inevitability](https://web.archive.org/web/20120701194521/http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=2754)" which means: if the game continues going how it's going now, who will win? The player who "has inevitability" will grind out a victory if they can prevent any important new developments. The player "without inevitability" needs to do something to change the situation or they'll lose.

We can view Western tech companies as having inevitibility in their quest to become independent, powerful entities unconstrained by governments. Both governments and tech companies are taking reputational hits from our chaotic information environment, but tech companies are able to weather the storm a bit better. 

Despite my borrowing of this term, neither centralization or decentralization of power is actually inevitable -- at least not as far as we can know. How this all plays out depends on the specific details of current and future technology, the existing structure of power when the technology is developed, and many other difficult to analyze factors.
