[Market Governance FAQ](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/Market_Governance_FAQ), March 2017.  
I explain why people should be less fearful of governance via hard fork on cryptocurrency platforms.

[Examining a Conspiracy Theory about Satoshi’s Intent](https://medium.com/@elliotolds/examining-a-conspiracy-theory-about-satoshis-intent-ce9de66d166d), January 2019.  
The topic of what Satoshi intended has been beaten to death. However the extent to which people in the Bitcoin community have been able to convince themselves of an extremely unlikely interpretation is interesting sociologically.

[A Libertarian Response to “Against Szabo’s Law”](https://medium.com/@elliotolds/a-libertarian-response-to-vlad-zamfirs-new-crypto-legal-system-f37ba8a6e76c), January 2019.  
An influential Etherean argues that the "code is law" philosophy of some blockchains is deeply misguided. I argue that it's a simple extension of libertarian political theory to crypto.

[Why we should be worried about an artificial intelligence explosion](https://medium.com/@elliotolds/why-we-should-be-worried-about-an-artificial-intelligence-explosion-b52bfdeaf7a), November 2017.  
An AI researcher makes some arguments against the idea of an AI explosion, which I critique.

[Critique of "An (Institutional) Investor's Take on Cryptoassets"](https://medium.com/@elliotolds/thought-provoking-paper-but-it-seems-to-be-using-the-equation-of-exchange-incorrectly-25f3148b85ea), January 2018.  
A flawed model of how to value cryptoassets was becoming popular, so I wrote this critique. 

[The Bitcoin block size debate is not jus tabout technical expertise](https://medium.com/@elliotolds/the-bitcoin-block-size-debate-is-not-about-technical-expertise-d3434beb04b2), Medium, January 2016.  
I explain how people with technical expertise often try to use their expertise in support of their views in illegitimate ways. The object level content is outdated but the dynamic I describe is very common and worth understanding.

A while back I created a [wiki](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org) about popular debates in the Bitcoin world, though it's now a bit out of date.

I often leave comments on other articles via my [Medium](https://medium.com/@elliotolds) account, so feel free to browse those.
