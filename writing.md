**[Would Bitcoin being overtaken destroy digital scarcity?](digitalscarcity)**, January, 2019.  
A common argument in the crypto world is that if Bitcoin is ever overtaken as the dominant cryptocurrency,
digital scarcity can never be restored. I examine this argument and the general style of reasoning that it embodies.

**[Some underappreciated reasons why single AI might take over the world](underappreciatedaitakeover)**, January 2019.  
A key reason why we should be worried about an AI takeover is that principle agent problems will play much less of a role in
AI systems than they have in human systems.

**[A Libertarian Response to “Against Szabo’s Law”](https://medium.com/@elliotolds/a-libertarian-response-to-vlad-zamfirs-new-crypto-legal-system-f37ba8a6e76c)**, January 2019.  
An influential Etherean argues that the "code is law" philosophy of some blockchains is deeply misguided. I argue that it's a simple extension of libertarian political theory to crypto.

**[Examining a Conspiracy Theory about Satoshi’s Intent](https://medium.com/@elliotolds/examining-a-conspiracy-theory-about-satoshis-intent-ce9de66d166d)**, January 2019.  
Satoshi's intent has been beaten to death and is not that meaningful. However the extent to which some Bitcoiners have been able to convince themselves of an unlikely interpretation is interesting sociologically.

**[Critique of "An (Institutional) Investor's Take on Cryptoassets"](https://medium.com/@elliotolds/thought-provoking-paper-but-it-seems-to-be-using-the-equation-of-exchange-incorrectly-25f3148b85ea)**, January 2018.  
A flawed model of how to value cryptoassets was becoming popular, so I wrote this response. You'll need to read the linked original article for context.

**[Why we should be worried about an artificial intelligence explosion](https://medium.com/@elliotolds/why-we-should-be-worried-about-an-artificial-intelligence-explosion-b52bfdeaf7a)**, November 2017.  
An AI researcher makes some arguments against the idea of an AI explosion, which I critique.

**[Market Governance FAQ](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/Market_Governance_FAQ)**, March 2017.  
I explain why people should be less fearful of governance via hard fork on cryptocurrency networks.

**[The Bitcoin block size debate is not just about technical expertise](https://medium.com/@elliotolds/the-bitcoin-block-size-debate-is-not-about-technical-expertise-d3434beb04b2)**, January 2016.  
People with technical expertise often try to cite their expertise in support of their views in illegitimate ways. 
This essay looks at a case of that happening and explains the general concept.

A while back I created a [wiki about popular debates in the Bitcoin world](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org), though it's now a bit out of date.
