What will be the long run effect of the Internet on the distribution of power? Will governments and big tech companies closely cooperate to strengthen their control over society?  Or can the [cypherpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) dream of the Internet as a tool of individual freedom and privacy be realized?

These questions are discussed in [The Centralized Internet Is Inevitable](https://palladiummag.com/2020/10/19/the-centralized-internet-is-inevitable/) by [Samo Burja](https://twitter.com/SamoBurja) and in [this podcast](https://palladiummag.com/2020/10/30/palladium-podcast-46-samo-burja-on-why-regulating-online-speech-is-unavoidable/) featuring Burja and [Palladium](https://palladiummag.com/) editor and cofounder [Wolf Tivy](https://twitter.com/wolftivy). Their position is that the Internet is an inherently centralizating technology.

I'll describe below how the Internet has already decentralized power to a large degree and why we might expect a continuation of this trend.

# **The Internet has decentralized control of information**

Compare the information landscapes in Western countries now vs. in 1990. Today we have easy access to a much wider variety of information and narratives, and these narratives tend to be more critical of large institutions and elites than the narratives people were exposed to in the past. 
 
These critical narratives have eroded the perceived legitimacy of these institutions and elites, as described by [Martin Gurri](https://twitter.com/mgurri) in [The Revolt of the Public](https://www.amazon.com/Revolt-Public-Crisis-Authority-Millennium/dp/1732265143) ([podcast with transcript](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/martin-gurri-revolt-of-the-public/), [ten minute version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhSaPi_zAyY&ab_channel=MartinGurri)).



In the pre-Internet era, everyone was deplatformed by default. There were a limited number of TV channels, radio stations, and newspapers making it necessary for information distributors to exercise heavy curation. This gave information distributors cover to curate partly based on the content's narrative. They wanted to distribute profitable content, but they also wanted to trade favors with powerful people and institutions who didn't want to be criticized.

The small number of informaiton channels made it more profitable to try to appeal to a broad swath of the population. The high costs of pre-Internet information distribution gave advertisers more control over content. Both of these factors limited anti-estalbishment narratives.



Today almost everyone can have a platform, but it's still true that only a small percentage of people have a large platform. There's still a fixed amount of attention to go around. Content on the Internet is implicitly filtered, but this filtering is done mostly based on popularity, with less narrative filtering than exists in legacy media.



So much information is produced on the Internet that people no longer need to ever return to the fold of mainstream narratives. Before the Internet even if you were reading subversive books you still probably got much of your news from TV or newspapers. Today someone might get almost all of their understanding of what's going on in the world and what it means from Joe Rogan, Eric Weinstein, Chapo Trap House, Scott Alexander, and Reddit.

Governments, the media, corporations, and educational institutions can no longer control which narratives are taken seriously in society and this is a direct result of the Internet.



# **Doesn't all this "decentralization" exist at the mercy of big tech companies?**

One might object that most anti-establishment narratives are spread via YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, which are all becoming increasingly powerful platforms. Isn't this just a manifestation of a tendency toward centralization? 

The reason why control of information is decentralizing depsite this is that in a world of with near-infinite information channels deplatforming someone is more conspicuous than in a world of few information channels. As described above, traditional media platforms must always exercise judgment about who they broadcast because of limited space, and they can use these judgments to deplatform people for reasons that are not obvious.

On big tech platforms deplatforming is the exception and the act of doing it attracts attention and demands an explanation.

Tech platforms do impose some narrative filter on information. There have been coordinated deplatformings of [Alex Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones) and [Richard Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_B._Spencer). Twitter recently prevented sharing of [a story](https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/) by the New York Post (a decision Twitter later [said they were wrong to do](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1317081843443912706)), and Twitter sometimes puts warnings on tweets, including Donald Trump's. Tech platforms have started instututing "soft" filters on some content by reducing the likelyhood that it appears in users' feeds. This week YouTube [said it would start deleting videos](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165355/youtube-biden-election-victory-misinformation-rules-remove-content-oan) which claim that the 2020 US election results are fruadulent.

It's important to compare this narrative filtering with what existed before the Internet. We're trying to figure out whether the Internet is leading us toward more centralization than what existed before, not whether it leads to more centralization than an ideal situation. 

Jones and Spencer would never have had their narratives broadcast on mainstream media pre-Internet. Even after his deplatforming, Jones (via his site [InfoWars](https://www.infowars.com/)) has almost ten times greater reach than The Economist. Jones' [most recent appearance on Rogan's podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVso9FSkmE&t=4s&ab_channel=PowerfulJRE) has over 15 million YouTube views (YouTube's ban on Jones does not extend to other channels that host him), 60% more views than ABC Nightly News, the top rated network TV news show.



# **What about China?**

The big tech companies in China cooperate more closely with the [Chinese Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party) than US tech companies do with the US government. If a similar situation of close cooperation between tech platforms and government developed in Western countries it could lead to significant centralization of power. Fortunately there may be no plausible path for this sort of sitation to develop in the West. 

When the Internet was first becoming widely used the CCP was in a position of higher information control than Western governments. They made a deliberate choice to maintain high information control over the course of the Internet's rise, and they've largely been successful. This took a lot of effort and planning. 

Western countries made little effort to control the flood of information stemming from the Internet and as a result have suffered the crisis of institutional authority described previously.

Maybe the US government could have avoided the crisis of authority and pressured tech companies into helping it solidify its power if it had more foresight before the Internet developed. But the US government is now in a situation where it lacks legitimacy and has little control of the narratives its citizens are exposed to. Without these things it's difficult to enact and enforce the far reaching policies (mandated encryption backdoors for instance) that would be needed to transition to high information control over its citizens.

# **Technological tools for resisting centralized power are becoming widespread**

Digital privacy advocates had been trying and failing to get people to use end-to-end encryption for decades. Technical challenges prevented the existence of user-friendly options, and people didn't care enough to go through the significant friction of using these tools. 

This changed in 2010 with the release of [TextSecure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextSecure), the precursor to [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)). WhatsApp, the world's most popular messaging app, has integrated Signal's technology and today two billion WhatApp users have end-to-end encryption enabled by default. Zoom, the world's most used video conferencing software, just released [their own end-to-end encryption feature](https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-rolling-out-end-to-end-encryption-offering/) in October 2020. 

For those serious about privacy Signal is preferable to WhatApp because using it [reveals less metadata](https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/) and the client is fully open source. Signal is as usable as any other messaging app and has become popular among [protesters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/style/signal-messaging-app-encryption-protests.html), [the European Commission](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150918/european-commission-signal-encrypted-messaging), and the [UK's ruling Conservative party](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150918/european-commission-signal-encrypted-messaging).

In short, we are in the midst of a massive global rollout of end-to-end encryption. For the first time in history normal people are regularly communicating remotely in a way that governments and companies lack the power to listen in on.

(We'll return to the issue of whether governments can read your Signal messages later).

A large number of skilled technologists are now working on another problem: creating a private, secure, uncensorable form of digital money that's easy to use and can support billions of users. The separation of money and state, if successful, would make it much more difficult for authoritarian governments to control their citizens.

Cryptocurrency isn't yet widespread 11 years after its creation and there are many unsolved problems, but progress is steadily being made and 11 years isn't that long. It was 25 years between the release of [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) (difficult to use software for end-to-end encrption) and when end-to-end encryption became widely used. It was at least 20 years between the invention of the Internet and when its decentralizing effects on the flow of information became significant.



# **Can't governments just backdoor our software and hardware?**

Western governments have been trying for decades to [ban end-to-end encryption](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/western-governments-double-down-efforts-to-curtail-end-to-end-encryption) and have mostly failed, with the (partial) exception of Australia's recent [anti-encryption law](https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/). This law has been [controversial](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2020/08/assistance-and-access-law-encrypted-messaging-explained/) and has been blamed for [reducing the competitiveness of Australia's tech industrsty](https://www.zdnet.com/article/labor-to-introduce-bill-to-fix-australian-encryption-laws-it-voted-for/).

I call this law a partial exception because Australians can still use end-to-end encryption via Signal. It's not technically possible for the Signal team to comply with the law, so the Australian government's options involve blocking Internet traffic to and from Signal servers or pressuring Apple and Google to remove Signal from their Australian app stores. They've done neither of these so far, and [Signal's blog post](https://signal.org/blog/setback-in-the-outback/) about this legislation reveals how to easily bypass both of these measures.

The situation in Australia is worth watching, but we won't get a good sense for whether Western countries could actually ban end-to-end encryption unless the Australian government makes a more serious effort to criminalize its use. 

The US government has worked with tech companies to [secretly get access to citizens' cloud data](https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet), and they have probably [secretly backdoored some hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cisco-backdoor-hardcoded-accounts-software,37480.html), but there is no law mandating that computer hardware have government backdoors. 

<!---
The bloomberg story often cited as evidence of Chinese hardware being backdoored is widely disputed by security experts. The general consensus is that bloomberg should have retracted the story. There are suspicions that Lenevo hardware may have been backdoored but this has never been established.

The most effective tehcnique for governments trying to access data on an iPhone that they have posession of is [trying every passcode combination](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/technology/iphone-encryption-police.html). Users can protect themselves againts this with long passcodes (10 digits will take about 12 years). There are [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute) instances of the FBI and NSA being unable to get into an iPhone. 

Governments may be able to hack into your phone remotely using [sophisticated spyware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)) if they can get you to click on a link, but proably not if you have the latest iPhone OS.

Given that the Internet has already stripped Western governments of much of their perceived authority, it's far from clear that citizens will hand these governments the additional power they need to access all of our data. We are not (yet) living in an authoritarian state -- Western politicians still fear the consequences of enacting and enforcing unpopular laws.


# **Power dynamics**

When an authoritarian government is able to bring its advanced tech industry fully under its control it creates a combined power structure that is difficult for citizens to fight back against. The government can use the tech platforms' control of information to legitimize its authoritarian actions, as well as quickly find and quell dissent. 

As discussed above the US is in a situation of low information control and low legitimacy. Even if the US government had access to all Internet data from all its citizens, it would be fairly constrained in the authoritarian actions it could take. 

For the US government to become significantly more powerful it needs to establish higher information control, which it can only achieve with the tech industry's help. But it's not in the interest of large tech companies to create an authoritarian system in the US. Such a system would lock tech companies into a role of subservience to a single political party, subject to the whims of its leadership. Consider the fate of Jack Ma, who was likely [forced out of Alibaba](https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibabas-jack-ma-denies-beijing-forced-him-out-1537280485) by the CCP. Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Page do not want to be in this position. They'd much prefer to exist in a world like that decsribed in [The Soverign Individual](https://www.nateliason.com/notes/sovereign-individual), where governments are relatively weak and are forced to compete with each other to attract companies and individuals.

In the US the balance of power between tech companies, government, and citizens is more evenly distributed than in China. The US government could theoretically threaten Facebook with nationalization or other harsh consequences if it didn't do its bidding, but politicians are beholden enough to public opinion that this would cause whoever spearheaded this effort to lose power. In general in any two of these factions could successfully team up against the remaining one if they wanted to. The main factor limiting what either the government or tech firms can do in the US is public opinion, and tech platforms are in a better position to influence public opinion than the government.

<!--
The internal divisions and checks and balances in the US government serve to make it easier for the US tech industry to avoid being brought into the fold of an authoritarian regime.
-->
<!---

Power within the US government is also more distributed than power within the CCP. There is more room for Facebook to play the Democratic and Republican sides against each other for its own advantage than for a Chinese company to try a similar move with factions within the CCP. 
-->

Tech platforms will often cooperate with the government when it's expedient, when they believe enough of the public would be against them if they didn't, or when they can be convinced that the request falls within the government's legitimate powers. Tech platform behavior can mostly be predicted by assuming their goal is to make as much money as possible over the long run. This involves avoiding becoming a political target. The censorship decisions of these companies is best understood as a delicate balancing act -- censor too much and citizens and politicians on the right become upset, censor too little and citizens and politicians on the left become upset (for encoraging the spread of alleged misinformation and/or hate). These companies aren't without [fear of the deep state](https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet), but this has its limits. They also frequently [push back](https://www.apple.com/customer-letter/) against government overeach when they have the support of citizens.

The US government may be able to transform itself into a powerful authoritarian government through some clever strategy, but they need the tech industry on board and it's unclear how they would achieve that.

# **Alternatives to increased centralization**

We've covered several reasons why centralization of power may not be inevitable in the West. If it doesn't occur, what might happen instead? 

One possibility is that the cypherpunks may prove to have been right in the end -- technology may finally usher in an era of increased individual freedom, at least in most countries that aren't currently authoritarian. We've seen above that end-to-end encryption is becoming widely used, and as more of the economy moves onto the Internet the case for cryptocurrency severing governments' control over money grows stronger. This possibility dovetails with the thesis of [The Sovereign Individual](https://www.amazon.com/Sovereign-Individual-Mastering-Transition-Information/dp/0684832720) and the vision described by Balaji Srinivasan in [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A). As the economy becomes more Internet-based, people and companies become more mobile, putting more competitive pressure on governments to curtail their own power and to respect individual rights.

Another possibility is that we develop new tools and institutions tailored specifically to this more chaotic information environment. The aim would be to help people better make sense of the large amount of questionable narratives they're exposed to and synthesieze them into reasonable beliefs about the world. The growing popularity of [prediction markets](https://polymarket.com/) is a promising trend in this direction. We may be able to alter the incentives present on social media networks with [targeted regulation](https://shevski.com/writing/breaking-big-tech-open). Through these types of developments it's possible that Western governments could become significantly more effectve without necessarily becoming more powerful.

Rather than listing further possibilities I'll note that the unprecedented level of technological change we're undergoing makes any long term political forecasting extremely uncertain.

Very few people foresaw the crisus of authority that the Internet has so far given us. It's very likely that future technological development will create a situation that we can't now foresee.
