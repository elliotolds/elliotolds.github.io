title: Can Technology Decentralize Power?

What will be the long run effect of technological progress on the distribution of power? Will governments and big tech companies closely cooperate to strengthen their control over society?  Or can the [cypherpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) dream of technology as a tool of individual freedom and privacy be realized?

These questions are discussed in [The Centralized Internet Is Inevitable](https://palladiummag.com/2020/10/19/the-centralized-internet-is-inevitable/) by [Samo Burja](https://twitter.com/SamoBurja) and in [this podcast](https://palladiummag.com/2020/10/30/palladium-podcast-46-samo-burja-on-why-regulating-online-speech-is-unavoidable/) featuring Burja and [Palladium](https://palladiummag.com/) editor and cofounder [Wolf Tivy](https://twitter.com/wolftivy). Their position is that the Internet is an inherently centralizing technology.

I'll describe below how technology has already decentralized power to a large degree and why we might expect a continuation of this trend.

# **The Internet has decentralized control of information**

Compare the information landscape in Western countries now to what it was in 1990. Today we have easier access to a wider variety of information and narratives, which are often more critical of large institutions and elites than the narratives people were exposed to in the past. This criticism has eroded the perceived legitimacy of institutions and elites, as described by [Martin Gurri](https://twitter.com/mgurri) in [The Revolt of the Public](https://www.amazon.com/Revolt-Public-Crisis-Authority-Millennium/dp/1732265143) ([podcast with transcript](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/martin-gurri-revolt-of-the-public/), [ten minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhSaPi_zAyY&ab_channel=MartinGurri)).


In the pre-Internet era everyone was deplatformed by default. There were a limited number of TV channels, radio stations, and newspapers making it necessary for information distributors to exercise heavy curation. This gave information distributors cover to curate content partly based on the its narrative. They wanted to distribute profitable content but they also wanted to trade favors with powerful people and institutions who didn't like criticism.

The small number of information channels meant there was no room for niche content -- it was most profitable to try to appeal to a broad swath of the population. The high costs of pre-Internet information distribution gave advertisers more leverage over content. Both of these factors limited anti-establishment narratives.


On the Internet almost everyone can have a platform, but it's still true that only a small percentage of people have a large platform. There's still a fixed amount of attention to go around. Content on the Internet is implicitly filtered (everyone only sees a minuscule fraction of all content produced) but this filtering is done mostly based on popularity. There is some narrative-based filtering but far less than exists in legacy media.

So much information is produced on the Internet that people no longer need to ever return to the fold of mainstream narratives. Before the Internet even if you were reading subversive books you still probably got much of your news from TV or newspapers. Today someone might get almost all of their understanding of what's going on in the world and what it means from [Joe Rogan](https://www.youtube.com/user/PowerfulJRE), [Eric Weinstein](https://www.youtube.com/user/nobani88), [Chapo Trap House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapo_Trap_House), [Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/), and Reddit.

Governments, the media, corporations, and educational institutions can no longer control which narratives are taken seriously and this is a direct result of the Internet.


# **Doesn't this "decentralization" exist at the mercy of big tech?**

One might object that most anti-establishment narratives spread via YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, which are all becoming increasingly powerful platforms. Isn't this just a manifestation of a tendency toward centralization? 

Control of information is decentralizing despite this because in a world of with near-infinite information channels deplatforming someone is more conspicuous than in a world of few information channels. Traditional media platforms must always exercise judgment about who they broadcast because of limited space, and they can use these judgments to deplatform people for reasons that are not obvious.

On Internet platforms deplatforming is the exception and the act of doing it attracts attention and demands an explanation.

Tech platforms do impose some narrative filter on information. There have been coordinated deplatformings of [Alex Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones) and [Richard Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_B._Spencer). Twitter recently prevented sharing of [a story](https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/) by the New York Post (a decision Twitter later [said they were wrong to do](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1317081843443912706)), and Twitter sometimes puts warnings on tweets (including Donald Trump's). Tech platforms have started instituting "soft" filters on some content by reducing the likelihood that it appears in users' feeds. This week YouTube [said it would start deleting videos](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165355/youtube-biden-election-victory-misinformation-rules-remove-content-oan) which claim that the 2020 US election results are fraudulent.

It's important to compare this narrative filtering with what existed before the Internet. The relevant question is whether the Internet is leading us toward more centralization than what existed before, not whether it's leading us to more centralization than we think is ideal. 

Jones and Spencer would never have had their narratives broadcast on mainstream media pre-Internet. Even after his deplatforming, Jones (via his site [InfoWars](https://www.infowars.com/)) has almost ten times greater reach than The Economist. Jones' [most recent appearance on Rogan's podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVso9FSkmE&t=4s&ab_channel=PowerfulJRE) has over 15 million YouTube views, 60% more views than the top rated network TV news show (ABC Nightly News).



# **What about China?**

Network effects have lead to most Internet communication being mediated by a small number of companies. China has shown us that if these companies are captured by a government the effect on power can be strongly centralizing. However there may be no plausible path for this sort of capture to develop in the West. 

When the Internet was new the [Chinese Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party) was in a position of higher information control than Western governments. The CCP made a deliberate choice to maintain high information control over the course of the Internet's rise and they've largely been successful. This took a lot of effort and planning. 

Western countries made little effort to control the flood of information stemming from the Internet and as a result have suffered the crisis of institutional authority described previously.

Maybe the US government could have avoided this fate if it had acted sooner, but it is now in a situation of reduced legitimacy and little control of the narratives its citizens are exposed to. Without these things it's difficult to enact and enforce the far reaching policies (mandated encryption backdoors for instance) that would be needed to transition to high information control over its citizens.



<!---
When groups are in competition they tend to focus on and take pride in their differences. The narrative "In the US we are free, unlike in China" is appealing to US citizens and will likely make them more reluctant to accept authoritarian governance than if the US and China were not in competition.

# **Tools for resisting centralized power are becoming widespread**

Digital privacy advocates had tried and failed to get people to use end-to-end encryption for decades. Technical challenges prevented the existence of user-friendly options and people didn't care enough to go through the cumbersome process of using these tools. 

This changed in 2010 with the release of [TextSecure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextSecure), which evolved into [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)). Signal uses [end-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption), produces [very little metadata](https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/), is open source, and is as easy to use as any other messaging app. Signal has become popular among [protesters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/style/signal-messaging-app-encryption-protests.html), [the European Commission](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150918/european-commission-signal-encrypted-messaging), and the [UK's ruling Conservative party](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150918/european-commission-signal-encrypted-messaging).

[WhatsApp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp), the world's most popular messaging app, has integrated Signal's technology and now two billion WhatApp users have end-to-end encryption enabled by default. [Zoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)), the world's most used video conferencing software, just released [their own end-to-end encryption feature](https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-rolling-out-end-to-end-encryption-offering/) in October 2020. 

We are in the midst of a massive global rollout of end-to-end encryption. For the first time in history normal people are regularly communicating remotely in a way that governments and companies lack the power to listen in on.

(We'll return to the issue of whether governments can read your Signal messages later).

Thousands of software developers and researchers are now working on another problem: creating a private, uncensorable form of digital money that's easy to use and can support billions of users. If they succeed in separating money from the state it will make it much more difficult for authoritarian governments to control their citizens.

Cryptocurrency isn't yet widespread 11 years after its creation and there are many unsolved problems, but progress is steadily being made and 11 years isn't that long. It was 25 years between the release of [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) (difficult to use encryption software) and when end-to-end encryption became widely used. It was at least 20 years between the invention of the Internet and when its decentralizing effects on the flow of information became significant.



# **Can't governments backdoor our software and hardware?**

Western governments have tried for decades to [ban end-to-end encryption](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/western-governments-double-down-efforts-to-curtail-end-to-end-encryption) and have mostly failed, with the partial exception of Australia's recent [anti-encryption law](https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/). This law has been [controversial](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2020/08/assistance-and-access-law-encrypted-messaging-explained/) and has been blamed for [reducing the competitiveness of Australia's tech industry](https://www.zdnet.com/article/labor-to-introduce-bill-to-fix-australian-encryption-laws-it-voted-for/).

I call this law a partial exception because Australians can still use end-to-end encryption via Signal and WhatsApp. It's not technically possible for the Signal team to comply with the law, so the Australian government's options involve blocking Internet traffic to and from Signal servers or pressuring Apple and Google to remove Signal from their Australian app stores. They've done neither of these so far, and [Signal's blog post](https://signal.org/blog/setback-in-the-outback/) about this legislation reveals how to easily bypass both of these measures.

The situation in Australia is worth watching but we won't get a good sense for whether Western countries could actually ban end-to-end encryption unless the Australian government makes a more serious effort to criminalize its use. 

The US government has worked with tech companies to [secretly get access to citizens' cloud data](https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet) and they have probably [secretly backdoored some hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cisco-backdoor-hardcoded-accounts-software,37480.html) but there are no US laws mandating that computer hardware contain government backdoors. 

<!---
The bloomberg story often cited as evidence of Chinese hardware being backdoored is widely disputed by security experts. The general consensus is that bloomberg should have retracted the story. There are suspicions that Lenevo hardware may have been backdoored but this has never been established.

The most effective technique for governments trying to access data on an iPhone in their possession is [trying every passcode combination](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/technology/iphone-encryption-police.html). Users can protect themselves against this with long passcodes (10 digits will take about 12 years). There are [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute) instances of the FBI and NSA failing to get into iPhones. 

Governments may be able to hack into your phone remotely using [sophisticated spyware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)) if they can get you to click on a link, but probably not if you have the latest iPhone OS.

Given that the Internet has already stripped Western governments of much of their perceived authority, it's far from clear that citizens will hand these governments the additional power they need to access all of our data. We are not yet living in an authoritarian state -- Western politicians still fear the consequences of enacting and enforcing unpopular laws.

# **The Internet is making physical location less important**

When humans were hunter-gatherers power was much more decentralized than it is today. One group could not rule over that many people both because the state of technology meant that the ability to inflict violence was proportional to the size of a group, and because the lack of permanent settlements made it easy for subgroups to leave.

The invention of agriculture allowed permanent settlements, caused the accumulation of large stores of wealth that were hard to move, and created economic network effects around physical locations. Whoever controlled a location could extract resources from those wanting to benefit from being near it. Our modern system of nations is a continuation of this trend.

The Internet is bringing us back to a situation where it's less important to physically be in any one place. We can now get close to the center of economic and intellectual activity from any physical location. This increases competitive pressure on governments and tilts power toward individuals.

# **Power dynamics in the US**

<!---
When an authoritarian government is able to fully control the tech platforms that its citizens use to communicate it creates a power structure that is difficult for citizens to push back against. The government can use the tech platforms' control of information to legitimize its authoritarian actions, as well as to quickly find and quell dissent. 
-->


Even though the US government [knows a lot about its citizens](https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet), its low information control and low legitimacy constrain the authoritarian actions it can take. For the US government to become significantly more powerful it would need to establish higher information control, which it could only achieve with the tech industry's help. 

However it's not in the interest of tech companies to help the US government become authoritarian. Such a system would lock tech companies into a subservient role, subject to the whims of the ruling party. Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Page do not want to be in the position of Jack Ma, who was likely [forced out of Alibaba](https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibabas-jack-ma-denies-beijing-forced-him-out-1537280485) by the CCP. 

In the US the balance of power between tech companies, government, and citizens is more evenly distributed than in China leading to more of a (temporary) stalemate. In the struggle between tech platforms and the US government the support of the public is critical, leading to caution from both groups about abusing their power.

<!---

They'd prefer a world more like the one described in [The Soverign Individual](https://www.nateliason.com/notes/sovereign-individual), where governments are relatively weak and are forced to compete with each other to attract companies and citizens.

The US government could not force Zuckerberg to step down without creating public backlash and causeing the politicians responsible to lose power. 
-->
<!---


Tech companies are roughly trying to make as much money as possible over the long run. An important part of this goal is not unnecessarily becoming a political target. The censorship decisions of these companies are best understood as a delicate balancing act -- censor too much and the right becomes upset, censor too little and the left becomes upset (for helping to spread alleged misinformation or hate). [PRISM](https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet) gives the government a lot of data but we're far from it being used for political control. Tech companies frequently [push back](https://www.apple.com/customer-letter/) against government overreach when they have the support of citizens.

-->
<!---

There may be a clever strategy that allows the US government to become authoritarian despite the tech industry and the public being aligned against that outcome and despite its low informaiton control and low legitimacy, but it's not clear what such a strategy would look like.



They will often cooperate with the government when it's expedient or when they believe enough of the public would be against them if they didn't.

# **Technology and power**

Most technologies increase power across the full spectrum between large organizations and individuals, but they do so unevenly. 

Artificial intelligence becomes more effective the more data and computing power you have, so we should expect it to increase the power of large organizations more than smaller ones. The [crossbow](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/from-crossbows-to-cryptography.pdf) was an example of a technology that helped individuals more than large organizations -- it enabled untrained peasants to effectively wield deadly force. Encryption and cryptocurrency also help to level the playing field between large organizations and individuals.

Whether power centralizes in the future depends on the specific details of current and future technology, the existing structure of power when this technology is developed, and many other difficult to analyze factors. We're living through [a period of rapid technological progress](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/modeling-human-trajectory) so it's hard to know these details, but we've seen many factors pushing in the direction of decentralization. For those of us who prefer to avoid an authoritarian future it would be a mistake to prematurely accept that fate.

<!---

But as we've seen there are many factors pushing toward decentralization. 

We're living through a period of rapid technological progress so should be uncertain about whether greater centralization nor greater decentralization is inevitable.

There are many effects of the Internet -- some centralizing, some decentralizing. Network effects have lead to most Internet communication being mediated by a small number of companies. China has shown us that if these companies are captured by a government the effect on power can be strongly centralizing. In the West we see more of a stalemate between tech platforms and governments, and we see caution from tech platforms about using their power. The practical effect is that the Internet has decentralized the flow of information in the West and stripped governments of much of their authority. The overall growth of the Internet is putting more competitive pressure on governments -- another decentralizing effect.

How this all plays out depends on the specific details of current and future technology, the existing structure of power when this technology is developed, and many other difficult to analyze factors.

# **Inevitability**

In Magic the Gathering there's a concept called "[inevitability](https://web.archive.org/web/20120701194521/http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=2754)" which means: if the game continues going how it's going now, who will win? The player who "has inevitability" will grind out a victory if they can prevent any important new developments. The player "without inevitability" needs to do something to change the situation or they'll lose.

We can view Western tech companies as having inevitibility in their quest to become independent, powerful entities unconstrained by governments. Both governments and tech companies are taking reputational hits from our chaotic information environment, but tech companies are able to weather the storm a bit better. 

Despite my borrowing of this term, neither centralization or decentralization of power is actually inevitable -- at least not as far as we can know. How this all plays out depends on the specific details of current and future technology, the existing structure of power when the technology is developed, and many other difficult to analyze factors.

Centralization due to technological progress is not inevitable but

Whether citizens of Western governments will end up living under authoritarian rule depends on many difficult to analyze details, including details about current and future technologies. The idea that technological progress is inevita

This has eroded the authority of intsitutions and elites, and it's unclear if they'll be able to recover. 

In light of the factors above, I believe it's at least plausible that the result will be increased decentralization.

We've seen several reasons why centralization of power may not be inevitable in the West. If it doesn't occur, what might happen instead? 

One possibility is that the cypherpunks may prove to have been right in the end -- technology may finally usher in an era of increased individual freedom, at least in most countries that aren't currently authoritarian. We've seen above that end-to-end encryption is becoming widely used, and as more of the economy moves onto the Internet the case for cryptocurrency severing governments' control over money grows stronger. This possibility dovetails with the thesis of [The Sovereign Individual](https://www.amazon.com/Sovereign-Individual-Mastering-Transition-Information/dp/0684832720) and the vision described by Balaji Srinivasan in [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A). As the economy becomes more Internet-based, people and companies become more mobile, putting more competitive pressure on governments to curtail their own power and to respect individual rights.

Another possibility is that we develop new tools and institutions tailored specifically to this more chaotic information environment. The aim would be to help people better make sense of the large amount of questionable narratives they're exposed to and synthesieze them into reasonable beliefs about the world. The growing popularity of [prediction markets](https://polymarket.com/) is a promising trend in this direction. We may be able to alter the incentives present on social media networks with [targeted regulation](https://shevski.com/writing/breaking-big-tech-open). Through these types of developments it's possible that Western governments could become significantly more effectve without necessarily becoming more powerful.

Rather than listing further possibilities I'll note that the unprecedented level of technological change we're undergoing makes any long term political forecasting extremely uncertain. The following image represents [simulations of economic growth trajectories](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/modeling-human-trajectory) by [David Roodman](https://davidroodman.com/about/).

Very few people foresaw the crisus of authority that the Internet has so far given us. It's very likely that future technological development will create a situation that we can't now foresee.
